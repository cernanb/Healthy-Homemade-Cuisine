        <p><strong>What is the difference between a Personal Chef &amp; a Private Chef?</strong></p>
        <p>A private chef is employed by one individual or family full time, and is often “living in”, and preparing up to 3 meals per day. A personal chef serves several clients, usually one per day and provides multiple meals that are custom designed for the client’s requests and requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you know what I like in my diet?</strong></p>
        <p>Right from the beginning, your tastes and preferences are the first priority. Before any menus are planned, we will meet and do a complimentary food assessment. A survey if you will. Your likes, dislikes and any goals you are trying to achieve and any dietary restrictions you may have.  We will consider not only your food preferences and dietary requirements, but also your schedule and meal habits to develop a truly personalized service plan.</p>
        <p><strong>How will my meals be packaged?</strong></p>
        <p>There are a variety of options for meal packaging. We can discuss this when we meet. Clients have the option to purchase at their cost Pyrex or equivalent containers if that is a preference or use what they already have.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you have to prepare the meals in my home? </strong></p>
        <p>Health Department regulations require that all meals be prepared either in the home of the consumer, or in a licensed and inspected commercial kitchen. Preparing meals in your home insures that you are provided with the freshest, highest quality food possible.</p>
        <p><strong>How long will you be in my home? Should I be there?</strong></p>
        <p>Depending on the number of entrees, a typical service takes from five to six hours. I am happy to accommodate your schedule in any way I can.</p>
        <p>You do not need to be home during the service. In fact, most clients are not at home. We can arrange a key pick-up or I can arrive before you leave in the morning.</p>
        <p><strong>What type of side dishes do you prepare?</strong></p>
        <p>I prepare side dishes that compliment the entrée you have selected. For instance if you have ordered a Herb Roasted Chicken, I would suggest Mashed Potatoes or a Rice Pilaf and A vegetable or salad.</p>
        <p><strong>What if I want you to prepare additional side dishes as well?</strong></p>
        <p>I’d be happy to provide that service for you. However, it will entail an additional fee.</p>
        <p><strong>How long will the food last us?</strong></p>
        <p>Depending on how many entrees you order, and how many evenings you eat at home I can determine approximately how long meals will last five evening meals and side will take you from Monday to Friday with ease.  If you travel for business or entertain in restaurants during the week or just enjoy eating out on occasion’ your meals will take you further than if you eat in each night.<br />
        <strong>Is it possible to custom design a service?</strong></p>
        <p>My services are completely flexible, so that almost any request can be accommodated. If you find that you have more leftovers than you need, I can plan a weekly service for you. If you find that you don’t have enough food I can do a monthly service.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I order half the regular service?</strong></p>
        <p>I wish I could make that available to you, but the service doesn’t work that way. For this to be a profitable business for me, I can’t do the same amount of cooking time and produce half the amount of food. It takes the same amount of planning, shopping and prep time to cook 10 portions of food as it does for 20 portions of food.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I buy a gift certificate?</strong></p>
        <p>Absolutely! Gift Certificates are available for my standard $300.00 service. They are excellent for New and elderly Parents, Get Well Soon, Wedding or Bridal Shower, Thank You or Anniversary.</p>
        <p><strong>How Do I Pay? Am I locked in for a period of time?</strong></p>
        <p>A check for the personal chef service is required in advance of the first service date. Payment is required in advance because I am reserving a scheduled date for you.  No you are not locked in. You may discontinue service at anytime.</p>
        <p><strong>The cost seems to be about the same as what I pay for dinner in a restaurant…why is that?</strong></p>
        <p>Personal Chef service fees include assessment of your tastes and needs, menu planning, research for specialty diets, shopping, meal preparation, packaging and storage of your meals and clean up. These services are essentially different from what you pay for at a restaurant.</p>
        <p>When you go to a restaurant, you have to travel there, wait for a table, wait for a menu, wait for your meal, hope that your special requests are honored, tip the waiter and drive back home.</p>
        <p>With a personal chef, you can relax, spend more time on the important aspects of your life and trust that you’ll have a lovely meal, specifically prepared to your palate, waiting for you at home. You’ll be less likely to resort to low-quality, unhealthy fast food as well as less likely to make impulse purchases in the grocery store. Remember all the produce you’ve bought with the best intentions, only to throw it out in the end? No more of that!</p>
