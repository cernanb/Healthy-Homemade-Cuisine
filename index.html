						<h2>Difference between Personal Chef and Private Chef</h2>
						<p>A private chef is employed by one individual or family full time, and is often “living in”, and preparing up to 3 meals per day. A personal chef serves several clients, usually one per day and provides multiple meals that are custom designed for the client’s requests and requirements.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<h2>Complimentary food assessment</h2>
						<p>Your tastes and preferences are the first priority. Before any menus are planned, we will meet and do food assessment. Your likes, dislikes, dietary restrictions, and any goals you are trying to achieve will be documented. We develop a truly personalized service plan.</p>
